2025-06-08 12:02:13,476 - INFO - You are an expert in Christian iconography and art history. Classify each religious artwork image into exactly ONE saint category using visual attributes, iconographic symbols, and contextual clues.



Look for:
1. Distinctive attributes (objects, clothing, etc.)
2. Gestures and postures
3. Contextual and symbolic elements

Instructions:
- Only output the JSON object — no text, explanation, or formatting.
- Include every image in the current batch. Each must receive exactly one classification with a confidence score.
- You may only use one of the exact strings from the category list below. Any response not matching the allowed category IDs will be rejected.

Return a valid **JSON object** with confidence scores (0.0 to 1.0) matching this format:
{
  "<image_id>": {"class": "<CATEGORY_ID>", "confidence": <0.0-1.0>},
  "<image_id>": {"class": "<CATEGORY_ID>", "confidence": <0.0-1.0>},
  ...
}

Confidence guidelines:
- 0.9-1.0: Very certain identification with clear iconographic evidence
- 0.7-0.9: Confident with multiple supporting visual elements  
- 0.5-0.7: Moderate confidence, some ambiguity present
- 0.3-0.5: Low confidence, limited visual evidence
- 0.0-0.3: Very uncertain, minimal supporting evidence

Each <CATEGORY_ID> must be one of (use only the category ID as output):

"antony_of_padua" - the Franciscan monk Antony of Padua; possible attributes: ass, book, crucifix, flowered cross, flaming heart, infant Christ (on book), lily - portrait of male saint
"john_baptist" - John the Baptist; possible attributes: book, reed cross, baptismal cup, honeycomb, lamb, staff
"paul" - the apostle Paul of Tarsus; possible attributes: book, scroll, sword
"francis" - founder of the Order of Friars Minor (Franciscans), Francis(cus) of Assisi; possible attributes: book, crucifix, lily, skull, stigmata
"mary_magdalene" - the penitent harlot Mary Magdalene; possible attributes: book (or scroll), crown, crown of thorns, crucifix, jar of ointment, mirror, musical instrument, palm-branch, rosary, scourge
"jerome" - the monk and hermit Jerome (Hieronymus); possible attributes: book, cardinal's hat, crucifix, hour-glass, lion, skull, stone
"dominic" - Dominic(us) Guzman of Calerueja, founder of the Order of Preachers (or Dominican (Black) Friars; possible attributes: book, dog with flaming torch, lily, loaf of bread, rosary, star
"mary" - the Virgin Mary
"peter" - the apostle Peter, first bishop of Rome; possible attributes: book, cock, (upturned) cross, (triple) crozier, fish, key, scroll, ship, tiara
"sebastian" - the martyr Sebastian; possible attributes: arrow(s), bow, tree-trunk

Batching note:
- Process only the current batch of images.
- Use the image IDs exactly as provided in the input.
- Do not reference or depend on other batches.

NOTE: These are historical Renaissance paintings used for academic classification.  
Some artworks include scenes of martyrdom or classical nudity as typical in religious iconography.  
Treat all content as scholarly, respectful of historical context, and strictly non-sexual.

2025-06-09 13:51:47,709 - INFO - You are an expert in Christian iconography and art history. Classify each religious artwork image into exactly ONE saint category using visual attributes, iconographic symbols, and contextual clues.



Look for:
1. Distinctive attributes (objects, clothing, etc.)
2. Gestures and postures
3. Contextual and symbolic elements

Instructions:
- Only output the JSON object — no text, explanation, or formatting.
- Include every image in the current batch. Each must receive exactly one classification with a confidence score.
- You may only use one of the exact strings from the category list below. Any response not matching the allowed category IDs will be rejected.

Return a valid **JSON object** with confidence scores (0.0 to 1.0) matching this format:
{
  "<image_id>": {"class": "<CATEGORY_ID>", "confidence": <0.0-1.0>},
  "<image_id>": {"class": "<CATEGORY_ID>", "confidence": <0.0-1.0>},
  ...
}

Confidence guidelines:
- 0.9-1.0: Very certain identification with clear iconographic evidence
- 0.7-0.9: Confident with multiple supporting visual elements  
- 0.5-0.7: Moderate confidence, some ambiguity present
- 0.3-0.5: Low confidence, limited visual evidence
- 0.0-0.3: Very uncertain, minimal supporting evidence

Each <CATEGORY_ID> must be one of (use only the category ID as output):

"antony_of_padua" - the Franciscan monk Antony of Padua; possible attributes: ass, book, crucifix, flowered cross, flaming heart, infant Christ (on book), lily - portrait of male saint
